# Path of the Bunny

A crazy labyrinth.

Your goal is to reach the top of the labyrinth while you only have a certain
amount of available moves.

You can move the rows to the left and right, while between every turn, there
will be a vertical movement.

If you run out of movements, it will be game over, but if you reach the goal in
time, you can call yourself a master of this labyrinth.

You can only move on connected lines though - and because this is a game jam
game (#igjam13), the art was done in a rush, so it might not be that visible
which lines go where.

When you can move the bunny around, There will be connection points highlighted.
You can only move to the next tile. Per turn you can move as many moves you want.

You can play with your mouse - no keyboard/controller is supported.
